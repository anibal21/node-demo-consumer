It is extremely useful for setting up separate development instances for your projects - no matter if you're doing PHP development with N different versions of PHP (as some sites may still be stuck at 5.6 while others are already requiring 7.2 due to Composer dependencies) or, worse, \u003cem\u003enodejs\u003c/em\u003e and Java where each project will have its own requirements for node, Tomcat and whatnot.\u003cp\u003eI personally set up one mega-container for each project which runs all the services required - mysql/pgsql for the database, apache as frontend / mod-php, if needed Tomcat - and can simply shut them down when I'm done working on a project instead of having the databases and servers all consuming memory and resources all the time.",

Currently, it is structured as a binary tree such that an append-only log is possible (ideal for handling updates on a traditional SSD). This is a very complex and time-consuming part of the implementation.\u003cp\u003eWith this KV drive, I could potentially \u0026#x27;hardware accelerate\u0026#x27; my database backend and all of the complexity of log-structured merge trees falls away. It would just be a handful of calls into a KV SSD library that handles the magic of getting a KV pair to disk. All I would need to worry about are the higher-order primitives I can build on top of a KV store. Using hashing schemes and clever metadata structures, you can encode virtually unlimited amounts of information into a 256 bit key. One simple flat store of KV items can contain all of your indexes, objects, scripts, jobs, settings, etc. Additionally, using hashed metadata keys lends itself well to sharing the store across unlimited drives and nodes. 256 bits comprises an unimaginably large key space, and SHA512 is actually even faster to execute on most x86 64-bit hardware if you can eat the 2x overhead on keys (which can be safely assumed to be inexhaustible through the heat death of the universe at this point).",

Currently, it is structured as a binary tree such that an append-only log is possible (ideal for handling updates on a traditional SSD).

It would just be a handful of calls into a KV SSD library that handles the magic of getting a KV pair to disk.
