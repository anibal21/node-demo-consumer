		"comment_text": "- Because of a perfect balance between simplicity, elegance, and pragmatism.\u003cp\u003e- Because of \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; REPL. Having to be able to evaluate any expression without any ceremony, right from your IDE, with one or a couple of keystrokes is remarkably liberating. No language I have tried gives me that enormous boost when prototyping things. Even refactoring existing code is much faster, because of the tightened feedback loop. Only Smalltalk comes close enough, sadly, Smalltalk has been dormant in years, and I don\u0026#x27;t think it ever comes back as a pragmatic choice to build a business upon. Whenever anyone retorts \u0026quot;Python has REPL, Ruby too, etc.\u0026quot; - it is just sad to see their ignorance. One has to give a heartfelt try to understand what makes Lisp REPL so unique.\u003cp\u003e- Because it is currently probably the best PL for building web-apps. You get real code-reuse, which even in NodeJS with JS\u0026#x2F;TS turned out to be an unfulfilled promise. You cannot merely share say data validation logic between back-end and front-end, even in NodeJS, let aside other languages.

Having to be able to evaluate any expression without any ceremony, right from your IDE, with one or a couple of keystrokes is remarkably liberating. No language I have tried gives me that enormous boost when prototyping things. Even refactoring existing code is much faster, because of the tightened feedback loop. Only Smalltalk comes close enough, sadly, Smalltalk has been dormant in years, and I don't think it ever comes back as a pragmatic choice to build a business upon. Whenever anyone retorts \u0026quot;Python has REPL, Ruby too, etc.\u0026quot; - it is just sad to see their ignorance. One has to give a heartfelt try to understand what makes Lisp REPL so unique.\u003cp\u003e- Because it is currently probably the best PL for building web-apps.
